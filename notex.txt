---------

 * Widen the mosfet pads for hand-soldering.
 * Make the uC's pads shorter.
 * give more space for the USB sheild pin as it bends over and collides with
   the switch pad.
 * Board is slightly asymetrical.
 * Make a new version with barrel jacks for the christmas tree.

Component selection
-------------------

 * the NE7000 can be substituted for any N-type with a Vth around 1-2 V. and
   can switch 5V,
 * The AO3400 can be substituted for any N-type that can handle 600mA of
   current, and switch 5V.  And disipate 1.25W of heat.
 * Likewise AO3401 can be substituted for any P-type that can handle 600mA of
   current and switch 5V.
 * TODO resistor tollerance
 * TODO current limiter advice.


Assembly notes
--------------

Solder the small SMD components first, it's easier to reach them before you
put the big ones in.

Solder the switches before mounting the USB ports, the usb port shield pin
will interfere with switch soldering.

Do not confuse the mosfet types.  They're different for good reasons.
p-type and n-type just arnt' compatible.  However, the NE7000 can be
substituted with more AO3400 units (probably), but not the other way around.

TODO: Add alterantive 2 and 1 port versions with the current limiter.

Mount the uC with either pin headers or directly.  for direct soldering try
holding it in place with pins/wires in the through-holes then solder the
edges.
